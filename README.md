# Callex

**Callex** is an AI-powered customer support and appointment booking platform.

It allows businesses to deploy an AI agent that answers customer questions, books appointments, confirms schedules, and hands off to humans when needed — all from one system.

## What Callex solves
Businesses lose customers because of:
- Missed calls  
- Slow replies  
- Manual appointment booking  
- No 24/7 support  

Callex replaces this with an AI receptionist that works 24/7.

## Core Features
- AI chat & voice agent  
- Appointment booking  
- Customer memory  
- SMS / WhatsApp confirmations  
- Admin dashboard  
- Human handoff  

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js  
- Backend: FastAPI  
- AI: Ollama / OpenAI compatible  
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Vector DB: Qdrant  
- Infra: Docker, AWS  

## Vision
Callex will become a plug-and-play AI receptionist for any business.
